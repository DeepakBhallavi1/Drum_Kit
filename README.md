A drum kit is a collection of drums, cymbals, and sometimes other auxiliary percussion instruments set up to be played by one person. I created a it using HTML, CSS & JavaScript.


The HTML code creates a set of buttons, each of which has an associated audio element and image. The audio elements are loaded with sound files of different drum sounds. The images are used to represent the different drums on the kit.

The CSS code styles the buttons, audio elements, and images to make them look like a drum kit.

The JavaScript code listens for keyboard events. When a button is clicked, the JavaScript code checks the key code of the button that was clicked. 
Once the JavaScript code has the key code, it looks up the corresponding audio element and plays the sound file. This allows the user to play different drum sounds by clicking on different buttons.
